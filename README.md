# What's this?
This is a test repository where I can experiment with how things work with Git and Github without screwing up any actual projects on the off chance people have poor enough judgement to let me tinker with their stuff
If you're reading this, hi, there's not really anything here actually

Example of a line

This text was sent from buttons on my keyboard to be stored on a chip of glass and sand, and then copied to a stream of data running wirelessly via microwaves to my router, which was sent through subterranean cables, massive underwater cables across continents, and finally to a different chip of glass and sand, where I can request the same process in reverse whenever I like (i'm putting stuff from local to on the line)
